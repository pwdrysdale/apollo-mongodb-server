# apollo-mongodb-server
A basic server using Apollo and MongoDB

Many online courses use express-graphql and don't always connect up a database. I thought I would try to make use of the Apollo back end so that I might leverage some of the powerful features in the backend there in the future.  I also wanted to put a real database on the back myself, so I hooked all that up. Plan on using this for some future builds, partly as a basis (might make it express-graphql to help hookup auth, might also change up the database to get some SQL coding in there - I use it in the day job, so why not for coding too?).
